# Attendance (Admin)

## Overview
As College students, we all have seen how our Professors take attendance in classes, manually calling each and every single child's name and marking them present or absent. It is a very primitive way of marking student's attendance. Calling out each person's name in a lecture can easily take about 5-10 minutes, which is 5-10 minutes of study time in a class wasted. There are not many easy solutions for marking student's attendance out there - major methods include Biometric entries, such as using Facial Recognition or Fingerprint Scanners. These solutions are pretty expensive in nature and can create chaos (Be honest, we don't enter the class before it's like already 2 minutes late).

## How do we overcome this problem? 
Seeing the issue that we mentioned above, we planned on creating a solution that could help teachers for a faster and much better mode of attendance than a primitive one. The solution we came to was an application, which can help students mark their attendance when inside the class, without any roll calls. This application can help make time usage of a lecture more efficient in classes.
